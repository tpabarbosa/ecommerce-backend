# E-commerce Backend

This is a basic backend API implementation in **Node** and **Typescript** for an e-commerce website.

It makes use of **TypeORM** with a **PostgreSQL** database hosted at [**ElephantSQL**](https://www.elephantsql.com/) for data manipulation and persistence.

For user authentication and authorization it makes use of **JWT Token** with **Bearer header Authorization**.
